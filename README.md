# Controller Class

https://www.ardanlabs.com/live-training-events/kubernetes-controller-training-mar-15-2023.html

The Kubernetes control plane is arguably the most successful orchestration engine ever built. This course will dive into how it works and the concepts behind why it’s so effective. We will demonstrate how anyone can extend the control plane with additional functionality by building a production-grade controller through a series of exercises. All concepts are communicated through live diagrams and reinforced through joint coding sessions. Most teams find this material useful to kickstart company-projects after the course. By the end of this course, you will have the tools necessary to detangle the set of pipelines, scripts, lambda functions, and cron jobs that orchestrate software at most companies.
